## Tech Stack
The tech behind the application is MERN Stack:
1) `M` : Mongo DB
2) `E` : Express 
3) `R` : React 
4) `N` : Node

Apart from this, Css Lib like `Bootstrap` is used in order to make site responsive and for other stylings 

## Usage & Installation 

The root dir of the project contains the frontend made with React. The backend is inside the **`backend`** dir.Thus, you will have two **`package.json`** files, one for backend Node and one for frontend React

- Hit `npm install` for each dir (root & backend) to install the dependencies for frontend and backend respectively
- Run `node/nodemon index.js` to run the backend
- To run the React frontend , go to root dir and run `npm start`

You will be redirected to the `localhost:3000`.

**Note** : When running the backend , you should see `Server started at 5000 & Database connection successful` ensuring that your backend server has successfully started and MongoDB database connection has been established

**Note** : You need to have _mongo_ installed on you computer to be able to run the project. If not , install from [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
